# Algorithms

This directory contains algorithm implementations in various languages.

## Categories

- **sorting/** - Sorting algorithms
- **searching/** - Search algorithms
- **graph/** - Graph algorithms
- **dynamic-programming/** - Dynamic programming solutions
- **greedy/** - Greedy algorithms
- **recursion/** - Recursive solutions

## Structure

Organize by algorithm type, with implementations in different languages where applicable.

Each implementation should include:
- Time complexity analysis
- Space complexity analysis
- Example usage
- Test cases
